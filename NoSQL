# NoSQL databases (aka "not only SQL") are non tabular, and store data differently than relational tables. 
# NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph. 
# They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.

# Over time, four major types of NoSQL databases emerged: document databases, key-value databases, wide-column stores, and graph databases.

# Document databases store data in documents similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. Each document contains pairs of fields and values. 
# The values can typically be a variety of types including things like strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or objects, and their structures typically align 
# with objects developers are working with in code. Because of their variety of field value types and powerful query languages, document databases are great 
# for a wide variety of use cases and can be used as a general purpose database. They can horizontally scale-out to accomodate large data volumes. MongoDB is 
# consistently ranked as the world’s most popular NoSQL database according to DB-engines and is an example of a document database. For more on document databases,

# Key-value databases are a simpler type of database where each item contains keys and values. A value can typically only be retrieved by referencing its key, so 
# learning how to query for a specific key-value pair is typically simple. Key-value databases are great for use cases where you need to store large amounts of data 
# but you don’t need to perform complex queries to retrieve it. Common use cases include storing user preferences or caching. Redis and DynanoDB are popular key-value databases.

# Wide-column stores store data in tables, rows, and dynamic columns. Wide-column stores provide a lot of flexibility over relational databases because each row is 
# not required to have the same columns. Many consider wide-column stores to be two-dimensional key-value databases. Wide-column stores are great for when you need 
# to store large amounts of data and you can predict what your query patterns will be. Wide-column stores are commonly used for storing Internet of Things data and 
# user profile data. Cassandra and HBase are two of the most popular wide-column stores.

# Graph databases store data in nodes and edges. Nodes typically store information about people, places, and things while edges store information about the 
# relationships between the nodes. Graph databases excel in use cases where you need to traverse relationships to look for patterns such as social networks, 
# fraud detection, and recommendation engines. Neo4j and JanusGraph are examples of graph databases.
